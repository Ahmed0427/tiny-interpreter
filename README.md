# Tiny Programming Language Interpreter

## Project Overview

This project is a custom programming language interpreter written in C++. It supports basic arithmetic operations, conditional statements, loops, and variable manipulation. The interpreter converts high-level code into Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) and evaluates it, enabling the execution of simple scripts with variables, expressions, `print`, `println`, and `read` commands.

### Key Features

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation.
- **Logical Operations**: Includes logical operators such as AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and bitwise operations (`^`, `|`, `&`).
- **Comparison Operators**: Handles comparison operations (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`).
- **Conditional Statements**: Implements `if` statements for conditional execution.
- **Loops**: Supports `while` loops for repeated execution based on a condition.
- **Variable Handling**: Allows defining variables and using them in expressions.
- **Input/Output**: Supports reading from user input and printing output to the console.

## How It Works

### Parsing and Tokenization

The interpreter reads input as a string and splits it into tokens for further processing. It supports whitespace trimming and string parsing to manage the syntax effectively.

### Conversion to Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)

To evaluate mathematical expressions correctly, the interpreter converts infix notation (e.g., `3 + 5 * 2`) to postfix notation (e.g., `3 5 2 * +`) using the Shunting Yard algorithm.

### Expression Evaluation

The interpreter processes expressions in RPN using a stack to evaluate them based on operator precedence and associativity. This allows for evaluating complex expressions while handling errors like division by zero and power of zero.

### Execution Flow

The `main()` function reads from a file or uses embedded code for testing. It splits the code into lines, and each line is parsed and executed in sequence:
- **Read commands** store input values into variables.
- **Print and println** commands output values or strings to the console.
- **If statements** execute a block of code if the condition evaluates to true.
- **While loops** repeatedly execute a block of code as long as the condition is true.

## Code Structure

### Main Components

- **`trim()`**: Trims leading and trailing spaces from a string.
- **`split()`**: Splits a string into tokens based on a delimiter.
- **`isAllDigits()`**: Checks if a string contains only digits.
- **`isAllAlpha()`**: Checks if a string contains only alphabetic characters.
- **`isOperator()`**: Checks if a string is a valid operator.
- **`getPrecedence()`**: Returns the precedence of an operator.
- **`normalToRPN()`**: Converts an infix expression to RPN.
- **`evaluate()`**: Evaluates an expression in RPN and returns the result.
- **`executeInstruction()`**: Executes a single line of code.
- **`executeIfStatement()`**: Handles `if` statements.
- **`executeWhileLoop()`**: Handles `while` loops.
- **`handleInputLines()`**: Processes all lines from the input and executes them.

### Error Handling

The interpreter includes robust error handling for:
- **Syntax errors**: Invalid tokens or expressions.
- **Division by zero**: Checked before division operations.
- **Undefined variables**: Attempting to access variables not defined.
- **Infinite loops**: Limits the number of loop iterations to prevent non-termination.

## How to Use

### Direct Code Input

Modify the embedded `instructions` string in the `main()` function for quick testing.

### File Input

Run the program with a file containing the code as an argument:
```bash
./interpreter inputFile.txt
```
Ensure the file is formatted correctly, with lines of code and proper indentation for `if` and `while` blocks.

## Example Code

### Sample Code to Test the Interpreter:

```plaintext
read test
while test > 0
    read a
    read b
    b - a
    test = test - 1
```

### Input/Output:

The program reads values for `test`, `a`, and `b`, performs operations as specified, and prints the results.

## Installation and Running

### Clone the Repository and Navigate to the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### Compile the Code

```bash
g++ -o interpreter interpreter.cpp
```

### Run the Compiled Program

```bash
./interpreter inputFile.txt
```

## Running the Program

1. **Compile** the `interpreter.cpp` source file to create an executable:
   ```bash
   g++ -o interpreter interpreter.cpp
   ```

2. **Run** the compiled program with your input file:
   ```bash
   ./interpreter inputFile.txt
   ```
   This command processes `inputFile.txt` and provides the output based on the script's instructions.

## Problem Solving Potential

This project is a small step toward building an interpreter capable of executing code written in a custom-designed, pseudo-code-like language. While it is not yet fully equipped to solve competitive programming problems, it demonstrates the potential for creating a tool that can perform fundamental computations and handle basic programming logic.

The initial inspiration came from my attempt at solving [Problem A from Codeforces Contest 2009](https://codeforces.com/contest/2009/problem/A). My solution to this problem can be found here: [Solution on Pastebin](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpastebin.com%2F4FPPt1Pp%3Ffbclid%3DIwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR0XPebJeLE--AvKuT0gX09S3ojFOBYFkdLoGDCsZnw5E_plm_mX-4hCPFg_aem_yTf5e3eL7GkMKtnbtpSy-A&h=AT2z2CziHjZzeHVRxwBR6rGGCHSJUZcxgyP1u4czQoXSf5XmA4ZUQkaUggbcpGiznXe3PB3BsmUfRtE4bfj2h5nBWdu41vuFz2g9x10kiO4GOPjS8Mz0DSshMThuZ20-Md4lPw).

### Future Plans

The project is a starting point with plans for future development. With time, we aim to enhance its capabilities and make it more robust, potentially enabling it to tackle more complex competitive programming problems more efficiently.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for recurssion.
- Add support for functions and subroutines.
- Implement more data types (e.g., floats, strings).
- Improve error handling and debugging features.
- Create a more sophisticated parser for complex syntax.
